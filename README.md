Sun Grid Engine Vagrantfiles
============================

This repository contains a number of Vagrantfiles for various flavors of Linux
that configure a 2 node Sun Grid Engine cluster.  These can be adapted
for testing scientific computing packages that take advantage of grid
scheduling.

The repository is organized as follows:

 * master - A stub branch containing just this README.
 * centos/6 - A branch containing a Vagrantfile for CentOS 6.

Generally, branch names are intended to mirror the Vagrant box used as a base.

Disclaimer: Don't expect any support for these.  At this point my involvement
in science is strictly as a hobbyist.  I enjoy finding opportunities to 
accelerate the pace of science whilst also practicing with new technologies
that can be useful to me in practicing my profession.
